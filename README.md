# Mike Oxlong's Credit Card Securityâ„¢

Do you suspect that your credit card details have been stolen by a hacker? Well look no further, because this piece of generic software will solve all your questions - from whether life is a simulation to where you want to eat tonight.

## Features

-   **Dark theme**: Because even this shady piece of software has some standards.
-   **Accessible**: We, here at Mike Oxlong Technology (not a real company), leave no stone unturned.
-   **Made with Tauri**: Should be fast (fast enough)
-   **Detail verification**: So that you don't send any fake data (harmful for our business)
-   **Cross-Platform**: Yes.
-   **Safe and Secure?**: Yes.

## Tech Stack

-   [React](https://reactjs.org)
-   [Tauri](https://tauri.studio)
-   [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

## On a Serious note

-   This software is neither sending any data anywhere nor is it storing it.
-   Data verification:
    -   Credit card number is being checked with the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
    -   Expiry date is being checked via regex.
-   Unfortunately, the Mike Oxlong company does not exist (yet).
